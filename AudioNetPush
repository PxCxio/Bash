"Did you know you could stream audio or video on linux without any configuration? Note that this is a push model. So we have to start the streaming client first. This is what you have to do. On the streaming client, setup the listener."

$ nc -l -p 1234 | mplayer -cache 8192 -

This will wait for media from the network to play.
On the streaming server, push the media data (any mplayer playable file) thusly.

$ cat video.mpg | nc <ip/dns of streaming client> 1234



I just did a successfull netcat trial using netcat and sox:

On the receiving machine, I used an infinite loop:

$ while true; do nc -l 1234 | sox -t mp3 - -t ossdsp /dev/dsp; sleep 1; done

On the sending machine I sent an mp3 file:

$ cat ./00.mp3 | nc 10.18.22.250 1234
